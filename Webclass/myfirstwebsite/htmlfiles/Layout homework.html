        In this process, chemicals such as alum are added to the water, which causes small particles and impurities to clump together and form larger particles called floc. The floc can then be easily removed from the water through sedimentation or filtration

        This process involves passing water through various types of filters, such as sand, activated carbon, or membrane filters. These filters remove impurities and particles from the water and improve its taste and clarity

       <p>
        Disinfection is the process of killing or removing harmful microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, from water. Chlorine, ozone, ultraviolet (UV) light, and other disinfectants are commonly used for this purpose.

           <p>
            Reverse osmosis (RO) is a process that uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove dissolved salts and other impurities from water. The membrane allows water to pass through, but not the larger ions and particles, resulting in purified water
